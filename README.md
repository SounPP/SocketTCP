# SocketTCP
Create a Socket TCP sever for fun 


Project Started: 25: November : 2023 
Project Ended: 1: January : 2024

I'm building TCP socket sever for my personal Hobby if you want to check it out:)

## Overview

The SocketTCP project consists of a server and a client that allow you to send text or other data between computers using a TCP connection. The server listens for incoming connections, and the client connects to the server to send and receive data.

## Features

- **Bi-Directional Communication:** The server and client support bidirectional communication, allowing data to be sent and received between them.

- **Text and Byte Transmission:** You can send both text and binary data between the server and client. The data is transmitted in bytes, providing flexibility for various types of information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SounPP/SocketTCP.git
cd SocketTCP
